Wacky ChatGPT Stories,https://archiveofourown.org/works/58548847,KingTobiasI,"Hello. I have not posted anything since that fanfic where Sasha and Gabi cuddle up together because of the latter's inner demons. I apologise for that. So, to make up for it, I decided to publish something more random. I have made ChatGPT, that famous chatbot program, write me a bunch of silly stories, prompts to which I had initially collated for months and had modified recently, and then had the program generate these following 8 stories. Then, I made various modifications to each story, to align them more with my vision, and then saved it all on my tablet. This was all done during the course of around 6 days, most of the time when I was at a camping trip to Scotland with my dad and sister. Also, these stories may or may not have any relation to each other in this shared universe. Most of these are in the Attack on Titan universe, but I decided that some would involve crossovers.

If you happen to like any of these stories, and you would like to flesh them out further in a proper fanfiction, please let me know. And, without further ado, enjoy.","Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings, Graphic Depictions Of Violence, No Archive Warnings Apply, Sasha Blouse & Gabi Braun, Gabi Braun & Reiner Braun, Gabi Braun & Bluey Heeler, Sasha Blouse/Gabi Braun (one-sided), Hitch Dreyse & Pieck Finger, Sasha Blouse, Gabi Braun, Bluey Heeler, Reiner Braun, Kaya (Shingeki no Kyojin), Falco Grice, Jean Kirstein, Connie Springer, Reiner Braun's Mother, Gabi Braun's Mother, Gabi Braun's Father, Bingo Heeler, Bandit Heeler, Chilli Heeler (mentioned), Colt Grice, Edward John Smith (1850-1912), Thomas Andrews (1873-1912), William Murdoch (1873-1912), Charles Lightoller, Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, Armin Arlert, Annie Leonhart, Levi Ackerman, Hange Zoë, Pieck Finger, Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S.
