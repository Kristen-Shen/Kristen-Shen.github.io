# Sweet-Flavored E-Vapes Still Hook Teens, Despite Stricter Laws
<mark>Hi ‚úã! Take a look at my article ‚ö° ‚ö° ‚ö°  [here](https://kristen-shen.github.io/e-cigarette/).</mark>

## üìù A Snapshot of the Project
I delved into the [National Youth Tobacco Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about-data/surveys/national-youth-tobacco-survey.html) and analyzed the trend of teenagers' e-cigarette preference.
I also researched relevant [legislation](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/CDC-STATE-System-E-Cigarette-Legislation-Youth-Acc/4a8m-9cpy/about_data) across states and visualize the level of restrictions.

## üìä Methods
### Responsive Design
- Self-learned [online tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LdCRYI4uF0) 
- Self-learned basics of Adobe Illustrator
- Self-learned picture responsive design with adjusting `html/css` code
#### Quantitative + Qualitative Evaluation of States' Degree of Strictness on E-cigarette Regulation
- Self-learned multiple ways for better ggplot visualization
- Based on CDC's state legislation [data](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/CDC-STATE-System-E-Cigarette-Legislation-Youth-Acc/4a8m-9cpy/about_data), I summarized the types of enforcements and checked if additional regulation is placed under each act. 
- Then, I created a the numberical accessment of degree of strictness (can be found in `E-Cigarette Legislation Youth Access.csv`), based on the availability of three types of legislations and additional regulations.

### Visualization 
- [heat map](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/qARKD/):`pandas` + `python` for data cleaning; `datawrapper`for charting
- [bar chart](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/h1PCX/?v=3): `pandas` + `python` for data cleaning; `datawrapper`for charting
- [line chart](https://github.com/Kristen-Shen/Kristen-Shen.github.io/blob/main/e-cigarette/my_chart_final.png): `pandas` + `python` for data cleaning; `ggplot`for charting
- [table](https://kristen-shen.github.io/e-cigarette/): `html` + `css` + `boostrap`for web design
- body image with text wrap: `html` + `css` web design

## ü§î Afterthoughts
In this project, I practiced responsive design and created charts that is mobile and desktop friendly. I improved my design skills and familarized myself with using Illustrator to process images.

I learned how to work with complex and large dataset, considering which variables I should use. I also applied statistical concepts I learned in this project to consider the variables and conclusions I could make from the dataset. 

In general, I gained more experiences on data cleaning and improved my web design skills. 

This is a project that I investigated a lot of time and energy into. With an English literature background, I always have an interest to do word frequency analysis. This is my first step.

If I have more time to expand the project, I will try to make more charts to see the trend for e-cigarette preference by choosing multiple variables. I'd also conduct interviews to policymakers and teenagers on this topic.
