# The "Perfect" Foundation
<mark>Hi ‚úã! Take a look at my article ‚ö° ‚ö° ‚ö°  [here](https://kristen-shen.github.io/e-cigarette/).</mark>

## üìù A Snapshot of the Project
I delved into the [National Youth Tobacco Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/about-data/surveys/national-youth-tobacco-survey.html) and analyzed the trend of teenagers' e-cigarette preference.
I also researched relevant [legislation](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/CDC-STATE-System-E-Cigarette-Legislation-Youth-Acc/4a8m-9cpy/about_data) across states and visualize the level of restrictions.

## üìä Methods
### Word Frequency Analysis
#### Quantitative + Qualitative
- Self-learned [online tutorial](https://investigate.ai/text-analysis/counting-words-with-pythons-counter/) and explored different methods
- Self-learned [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/pca-visualization/) for 3D PCA analysis
- Used [Counter](https://pymotw.com/3/collections/counter.html) tool 
- semantic analysis consulting [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com/?tl=true) and [the academic paper](https://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/180034/selen_jennie.pdf?sequence=2)
### Visualization 
- [heat map](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/qARKD/):`pandas` + `python` for data cleaning; `datawrapper`for charting
- [bar chart](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/h1PCX/?v=3): `pandas` + `python` for data cleaning; `datawrapper`for charting
- [line chart](https://github.com/Kristen-Shen/Kristen-Shen.github.io/blob/main/e-cigarette/my_chart_final.png): `pandas` + `python` for data cleaning; `ggplot`for charting
- [table](https://kristen-shen.github.io/e-cigarette/): `html` + `css` + `boostrap`for web design

## ü§î Afterthoughts
This is a project that I investigated a lot of time and energy into. With an English literature background, I always have an interest to do word frequency analysis. This is my first step.

I benefited a lot from self online learning regarding word frequency and word embedding analysis. I also improved my charting skills through self-learning wordcloud and treemap with ggplot and R. 

I improved my data cleaning skills using pandas to create multiple tables. I began to pay more attention to details while reading the datasets. I also learned so much on web interactive design like scrolling and switchiing between different images and links.

Due to time limitation, I didn't get time to update the dataset by scraping the latest information on the two makeup websites as there are multiple security blockers on those websites. Though I didn't success this time, I gained valuable experiences on web scraping and what tools I should use.

In the future, if I have more time, I will try again for scraping the website to explore current trend. I'll also update my article if I get a chance talking to fashion experts.
