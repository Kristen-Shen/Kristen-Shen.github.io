# Sweet-Flavored E-Vapes Still Hook Teens, Despite Stricter Laws
<mark>Hi ‚úã! Take a look at my article ‚ö° ‚ö° ‚ö°  [here](https://kristen-shen.github.io/manifestation/).</mark>

## üìù A Snapshot of the Project
In this multimedia project, I creatively weave audio, data visualization, and video into my storytelling about a pop culture: manifestation. 
Translating a psychology research into accessible visualization, I explored the scientific explanation behind manifestation with lively audio and rich narratives. 

## üìä Methods & Visualization 
- [radar chart](https://github.com/Kristen-Shen/Kristen-Shen.github.io/tree/main/manifestation): `python` for data cleaning; `RAWGraphs`for charting; `Adobe Illustrator` for additional design
    - because radar chart visualize distance from the center, it can't include negative values.
    - I rescaled all negative values into postive ones, using the formula: 
        - normalized_value = (original_value + 1) / 2
        - It shifts the range from [‚àí1, +1] to [0, 2]; then divides by 2 to scale it to [0, 1]
- [multiple bar chart](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/XbMzD/): `python` for data cleaning; `datawrapper`for charting
- [subscale list & method post](https://kristen-shen.github.io/manifestation/): `html` + `css` for web design
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6EHa1hhnXQ)
    - Downloaded from [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6EHa1hhnXQ) using command-line tool :
    - `brew install yt-dlp`
    - `yt-dlp [video link]`
- [Audio](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hkjwQfkpSyqkAe222Fjme06rCnH3oBbc?usp=drive_link)
    - The audio piece include a wide range of sources and lively scenes.
    - I interviewed all sources and edited using `Adobe Audition`.

## ü§î Afterthoughts
This project, with several components, took me multiple weeks to work on. I improved my communications skills through talking to a wide range of sources like manifestation coach, psychotherapists, and scholars.
I also challenged myself to confront a research article and translate stastistical language into visualization accessible to general audience. I not only improve my data cleaning and visualization skills, but also further my understanding of statistical concepts and research methodology.

I also practiced more responsive design and Illustraor to process images. 

As always, my designs on the charts would be improved with better color and font selection. I'll keep working on designing as I further my skills in Illustrator. 
If I have more time, I'll create more charts related to the research survey and improve my overall web design.

I will also try audio visualization in the future to visualize the frequency of the music mentioned in the story.

In general, I think this is an extremely interesting and complex topic weaving multiple angles together like psychology, religion, pop culture, and potentially inequality. I will continute to work on it in the future.
