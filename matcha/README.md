## 🤔 Afterthoughts

This project I tried to combine multimedia narratives for an engaging storytelling. I furthed my understanding on how to balance the materials and improved my web design skills to ensure the display of each material.

Due to time limitation, I didn't get time to create more data visualization and shoot a video by myself. With more time, I will try to create more charts and video in the story. Web design, as always, could be improved, after I gaiin more experiences.
