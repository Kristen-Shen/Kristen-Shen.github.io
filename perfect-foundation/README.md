# The "Perfect" Foundation
Hi ‚úã! Take a look at my article [here](https://kristen-shen.github.io/perfect-foundation/).

## üìù A Snapshot of the Project
In this data-driven project, I explored all makeup foundation shades on [Sephora](https://www.sephora.com/shop/foundation-makeup?pageSize=300")
and [Ulta](https://www.ulta.com/?cmpid=PS_Brand!google!Brand&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&CAWELAID=1831598544&CATRK=SPFID-1&CAAGID=540267060&CATCI=kwd-12627301&CAPCID=476595550201&CADevice=c&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA8fW9BhC8ARIsACwHqYod1XSjB7B7oKtkhR8EVjgCWh3n5CQ9gDRON_RrIaVbun2XCeXteo4aAvuDEALw_wcB) U.S. webiste and analyzed the word frequencies of each product's name. 

I also contextualize the data with current fashion trends to examine its social and cultural embeddings.
